# Mousebelt University: Blockchain Development
Projects, notes, and code from Mousebelt University courses on Blockchain development. 

## Initial Setup Components and Descriptions:

#### GETH
Local node implementation of Ethereum, can be used for development and deployment. 

#### TRUFFLE
Testing framework for Solidity

#### METAMASK
In browser Chrome extension that can be used for calling contracts, and running tests. Metamask is actually a wallet, and can be used on the mainnet, or any of the major testnets.

#### TESTRPC

#### REMIX (https://remix.ethereum.org/)   
Online, Solidity specific IDE - built in solidity compiler

#### INFURA (https://infura.io/) 
Instead of setting up a node locally and waiting to sync on a new environment, Infura is a very simple way to get data from the testnet or mainnet on ethereum, and submit transactions. Allegedly, it is a bit unreliable for production applications, and for some custom applications.
